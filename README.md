## Plan:
  - Dungeon crawler roguelike
  - Random procedural room generation
  - Fight monsters
  - Levels beaten by escaping each level/dungeon
  - Chests and loot
  - Health and armor bar on top
  - Story/dialogue

  If I have time:
  - Classes (mana for a mage class)
  - 


## Style guide:
  - 2 space indents
