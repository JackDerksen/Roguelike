## Plan:
  - Dungeon crawler roguelike
  - Random procedural room generation
  - Fight monsters
  - Levels beaten by escaping each level/dungeon
  - Chests and loot
  - Health and armor bar on top
  - Story/dialogue

  If I have time:
  - Classes (mana for a mage class)
  - 


## TODO:
   - FIX MULTIPLE DEFINITIONS OF PLAYER_SETUP AND MAP_SETUP
   - Get the player '@' rendered to the screen
   - Create screen borders
   - Get basic rendering and movement functionality implemented
   - Create a splash screen, and get it working
   - Get procedural room generation working
     - Ensure that the map is random each time it's generated
     - Ensure that the player spawns on a valid "floor" tile
     - Place an exit somewhere on the map
     - Generate a new level once the player reaches the exit
     - Populate the rooms with chests and stuff (placeholders for now)

  All set for now, chief :)
